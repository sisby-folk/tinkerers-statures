This mod:
- Adds a new origins layer, allowing you to add or override player size from a selection of presets
  - Each preset has dimension information, flavour text, and item-icons inspired by *Alice in Wonderland*


If you'd prefer the datapack version for any reason, you can [download it from the repo](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-statures/tree/main/src/main/resources) (Direct Download Link)

Have fun building new door sizes! (have you tried [halfdoors](https://modrinth.com/mod/half-doors) or [dramatic doors](https://modrinth.com/mod/dramatic-doors)?)

## Further Info

All mods are built on the work of many others.

We made this mod for [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt)! Our modpack about ease of play and expressiveness.

We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
